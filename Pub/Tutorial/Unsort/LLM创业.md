There are several projects on GitHub that leverage AI to change clothes in images or to virtually try on clothes. Here's a summary of some notable ones:

1. **FashionAI**:
   - This project allows users to take a picture of a person and modify the clothing using AI. It uses a clothing mask to identify the clothing area and applies stable diffusion inpainting to modify the clothing【5†(source)】.

2. **Virtualrobe**:
   - It's an app that suggests outfits to wear from the clothes in your actual wardrobe. It automatically suggests outfits to wear from items in your actual wardrobe【6†(source)】.

3. **SwapNet**:
   - This is a virtual clothing try-on project with deep learning. The provided model in this project was trained on one body type, and it outputs cloth segmentations required for SwapNet【7†(source)】.

4. **SMART-MIRROR-FASHION-AI_SMFAI**:
   - A smart mirror-based AI network that allows people to virtually try on clothing onto their video overlay using CP-VTON+【8†(source)】.

5. **Virtual-Clothes-TryOn**:
   - This project aims to support web-based shopping by enabling users to try out apparel virtually. It develops a web application that accepts images of the person and the desired apparel, and uses the contour of the person for virtual try-on【9†(source)】.

These projects utilize various AI and machine learning techniques to change clothes in images or to enable virtual try-on experiences. They offer different functionalities ranging from modifying existing clothing in images to suggesting outfits and providing virtual try-on experiences.
